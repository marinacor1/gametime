## The Plan

### Describe Your goals for the finished product

- Bird is consistently trying to fly above the lava.
- If the player does nothing, the bird will drop into the lava.
- If the player types quickly and correctly the numbers that are appearing on the screen, the bird will stay above the lava.
- If the player has too many errors, types slowly or not at all, the bird will fall into the lava.
- If the player finishes typing a sequence of letters without the bird falling into the lava, they move onto the next level.
- Levels increase in complexity by the length of the text that they have to type, making lava grow and/ or making the bird fall faster.
- Player accumulates point and the game gets harder and harder and goes on forever...
- Two player mode where players compete for highest score.
